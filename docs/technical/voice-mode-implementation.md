# Voice Mode Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Voice Mode is one of three interaction modes (Portfolio, Chat, Voice) in the portfolio site, providing a fully functional voice assistant that can listen to user speech, process it with AI, and respond with both text and synthesized speech.

### **Recent Improvements (December 2024)**
- **Enhanced Stability**: Fixed critical syntax errors that were preventing compilation
- **Simplified Interface**: Streamlined VoiceBot component props (`isActive` only)
- **Code Quality**: Removed unused VoiceIndicatorBadge component and cleaned up codebase
- **Better Type Safety**: Resolved TypeScript errors and improved type checking
- **Improved Error Handling**: More robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms

## Key Features

### ✅ **Real Speech Recognition**
- Uses Web Speech Recognition API (Chrome/Safari/Edge)
- Continuous listening with manual start/stop controls
- Automatic transcription of user voice input
- Comprehensive error handling for various scenarios

### ✅ **AI Integration**
- Full integration with existing `generateResponse` chat service
- Uses the same AI backend as the chat mode
- Context-aware responses about Imran's work and projects
- Supports both local responses and OpenAI API integration

### ✅ **Speech Synthesis**
- High-quality text-to-speech using Web Speech API
- Configurable voice parameters (rate, pitch, volume)
- Automatic speaking of AI responses
- Manual stop/start controls

### ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**
- Visual state indicators (listening, processing, speaking, error)
- Animated waveform during voice activity
- Color-coded states with appropriate feedback
- Responsive design with accessible controls
- Real-time usage monitoring and cost tracking

### ✅ **Rate Limiting & Cost Control**
- Comprehensive rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Smart fallback to free TTS when limits reached
- Real-time cost estimation and usage tracking
- Configurable limits for different environments
- Session, hourly, and daily usage controls

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### **VoiceBot Component** (`src/components/VoiceBot.tsx`)

**State Management:**
```typescript
type VoiceState = 'idle' | 'listening' | 'processing' | 'speaking' | 'error';

const [voiceState, setVoiceState] = useState<VoiceState>('idle');
const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([]);
const [isSupported, setIsSupported] = useState<boolean>(false);
```

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Automatic detection of Speech Recognition API support
- Graceful fallback for unsupported browsers
- Clear error messaging for users

### Speech Recognition Flow

1. **User activates voice mode** → Component initializes and checks browser support
2. **Welcome message spoken** → AI introduces itself via speech synthesis
3. **User clicks listen button** → Speech recognition starts with visual feedback
4. **User speaks** → Audio captured and transcribed to text
5. **Processing state** → Text sent to AI service for response generation
6. **AI response received** → Text displayed and spoken via speech synthesis
7. **Return to idle** → Ready for next voice interaction

### Visual States & Feedback

#### **State Indicators:**
- **Idle**: Gray microphone icon, "Ready to help" message
- **Listening**: Blue pulsing icon, animated waveform, "Listening..." text
- **Processing**: Amber icon, thinking animation, "Thinking..." text
- **Speaking**: Green icon, speaking animation, current response text
- **Error**: Red icon, error-specific messaging, auto-recovery

#### **Waveform Animation:**
```typescript
const VoiceWaveform: React.FC<{ isActive: boolean; state: VoiceState }> = ({ isActive, state }) => {
  // Dynamic height based on voice state
  // Smooth Framer Motion animations
  // State-specific wave patterns
};
```

### Error Handling

**Comprehensive error coverage:**
- `no-speech`: No audio detected during listening
- `audio-capture`: Microphone access issues
- `not-allowed`: Permission denied by user
- `network`: Connection problems
- Generic fallbacks for unknown errors

**Recovery mechanisms:**
- Auto-clearing error messages after 3 seconds
- Graceful return to idle state
- User-friendly error descriptions
- Retry capabilities

### Integration Points

#### **Mode Toggle Integration**
Voice mode is seamlessly integrated into the existing mode toggle system:
```typescript
currentMode === 'voice' ? (
  <VoiceBot isActive={true} closeVoice={() => setCurrentMode('portfolio')} />
) : (
  // Other modes
)
```

#### **Chat Service Integration**
Uses the same AI service as chat mode:
```typescript
const response = await generateResponse(transcript, messages);
```

#### **Scroll Management**
Voice mode triggers scroll locking behavior similar to chat mode for focused interaction.

## Browser Support

### **Supported Browsers:**
- ✅ Chrome (full support)
- ✅ Safari (full support)
- ✅ Edge (full support)
- ⚠️ Firefox (limited speech recognition support)

### **Required Permissions:**
- Microphone access (requested on first use)
- Audio playback (for speech synthesis)

## User Experience Flow

### **First-time Usage:**
1. User clicks "Voice" in mode toggle
2. Browser may prompt for microphone permission
3. Welcome message explains voice capabilities
4. Visual indicators guide user interaction

### **Typical Conversation:**
1. User clicks microphone button to start listening
2. Visual feedback shows "Listening..." with animated waveform
3. User speaks their question about Imran's work
4. Voice stops, state changes to "Thinking..."
5. AI processes and generates response
6. Response is both displayed and spoken aloud
7. System returns to idle, ready for next interaction

### **Error Recovery:**
- Clear error messages explain what went wrong
- Automatic retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Fallback to text-based interaction when needed

## Accessibility Features

- **Screen reader compatibility** with proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard navigation** support for all controls
- **Visual state indicators** for hearing-impaired users
- **Reduced motion** support for motion-sensitive users
- **Color contrast** compliance for visual indicators

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy loading** of speech recognition only when needed
- **Promise-based** speech synthesis for better async handling
- **State cleanup** on component unmount
- **Memory management** for recognition instances
- **Background processing** doesn't block UI interactions

## Configuration Options

### **Speech Recognition:**
```typescript
recognition.continuous = false;        // Single utterance mode
recognition.interimResults = false;    // Wait for final results
recognition.lang = 'en-US';           // English language
recognition.maxAlternatives = 1;      // Single best result
```

### **Speech Synthesis:**
```typescript
utterance.rate = 0.9;    // Slightly slower for clarity
utterance.pitch = 1;     // Normal pitch
utterance.volume = 0.8;  // Comfortable volume
```

### **Vapi.ai Configuration:**
```bash
# Vapi.ai API Configuration (Primary Voice System)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_API_KEY=your_vapi_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=your_assistant_id_here

# OpenAI Configuration (Fallback)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Rate Limiting
NEXT_PUBLIC_VOICE_RATE_LIMIT_PRESET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_VOICE_MAX_CONVERSATIONS_PER_SESSION=3
NEXT_PUBLIC_VOICE_MAX_COST_PER_DAY=5.00
NEXT_PUBLIC_VOICE_MAX_CHARACTERS_PER_SESSION=3000
```

See `docs/voice-rate-limiting-guide.md` for complete configuration options.
