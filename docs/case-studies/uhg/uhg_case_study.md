# UnitedHealth Group: HSA Reimbursement Process Redesign
## Solving Multi-User, Multi-System Healthcare Financial Experience

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

**Challenge**: HSA reimbursement system serving 3.2M users had fundamental usability and technical issues causing 98.9% task abandonment and significant business impact.

**My Role**: Lead UX Designer responsible for end-to-end redesign, working with engineering, product, and compliance teams.

**Timeline**: 6 months design and implementation

**Key Constraint**: Healthcare financial regulations required maintaining specific audit trails and approval processes while improving user experience.

## üìä **The Problem Space**

### Business Context
UnitedHealth Group's Optum Bank HSA platform processes $2.8B annually in health savings account transactions. The reimbursement feature‚Äîwhere users submit medical receipts for approval‚Äîwas failing dramatically.

### Current State Analysis: The Failing System

**Existing Mobile App Flow:**
*[Reference: Section 1 in design mockups - "Current User Journey Map" showing the 8+ step process with 98.9% drop-off and emotional frustration indicators]*

**Existing Desktop Web Flow:**
*[Reference: Section 3 in design mockups - "Current Information Architecture Problems" showing how reimbursement is buried 4 levels deep with confusing navigation]*

**Key Issues Identified in Current Design:**
- Form fields scattered across multiple screens without clear progress indication
- Upload interface provided no guidance on photo quality or file requirements
- Error messages were generic ("Upload failed") with no recovery guidance
- Status updates were buried in account dashboards with unclear timelines
- Mobile and desktop experiences were inconsistent, causing confusion for cross-device users

### Evidence of the Problem

**Quantitative Data**:
- 98.9% of users abandoned the reimbursement process before completion
- Average completion time: 18 minutes for successful submissions
- 34% of customer service calls were reimbursement-related
- Only 1 in 90 users who started the process actually completed it

**Qualitative Insights**:
- "I gave up after the third time it lost my receipt"
- "I don't understand why my doctor visit isn't covered"
- "The app crashed when I tried to upload the photo"
- "I never know if my reimbursement was approved or denied"

### Why This Problem Was Complex

This wasn't just a simple flow issue. The complexity came from several interconnected challenges:

**1. Multi-Modal User Behaviors**
- **Digital-first users**: Expected instant, mobile-native experience
- **Traditional users**: Preferred desktop with detailed forms
- **Assisted users**: Needed customer service integration
- **Bulk users**: Submitting multiple receipts monthly

**2. Technical Architecture Reality** 
- File uploads had to work across 3 different backend systems
- Receipt processing involved OCR, validation, and manual review
- Mobile network variability caused frequent upload failures
- Legacy approval workflow couldn't be changed due to compliance

**3. Healthcare Financial Regulations**
- IRS rules dictated what information was required
- HIPAA compliance affected how data could be stored and transmitted
- State tax laws varied, affecting 40% of users differently
- Audit trail requirements meant every user action had to be logged

**4. Diverse Receipt Types and Scenarios**
- Pharmacy receipts (structured data, easy to process)
- Doctor visit summaries (complex, variable formats)
- Insurance EOBs (explanation of benefits, highly technical)
- Dental/vision receipts (different compliance rules)

- IT team: Technical constraints and system architecture limitations

### Key Research Insights

**User Journey Mapping: Current vs. Ideal State**

*[Reference: Section 1 in design mockups - "Current User Journey Map" highlighting pain points, emotions, and failure scenarios across mobile and desktop touchpoints with emotional frustration indicators]*

**User Mental Models vs. System Logic**:
- Users thought of expenses by event ("my dentist visit") while system organized by tax category ("preventive care")
- Users expected immediate feedback but system required 24-48 hour processing for compliance
- Users wanted simple yes/no decisions but regulations required detailed documentation

**Usability Testing Findings:**

*Current Interface Heuristic Analysis*:
*[Reference: Section 2 in design mockups - "Heuristic Evaluation Results" showing Nielsen's 10 principles applied with Critical, Serious, and Medium severity ratings for specific usability violations]*

**Technical Failure Analysis**:
- 67% of failures occurred during file upload (timeout, size limits, format issues)
- 23% of failures were form validation errors after receipt upload
- 10% were user confusion about required information

**Behavioral Patterns & Context of Use**:
- 78% of users started on mobile but 45% switched to desktop after failures
- Users who started on desktop had higher completion rates but lower satisfaction scores
- Successful mobile users all had consistent high-speed internet access
- Peak usage occurred Sunday evenings and during lunch hours on weekdays

**Information Architecture Analysis:**

*[Reference: Section 3 in design mockups - "Current Information Architecture Problems" showing site map with reimbursement buried 4 levels deep and confusing navigation paths]*

**User Personas Emerged from Research**:

*[Reference: Section 4 in design mockups - "User Personas" showing four primary user types: Digital Native (32%), Traditional Planner (41%), Assisted User (18%), and Bulk Processor (9%) with their specific goals, frustrations, and preferred interaction patterns]*

*The Digital Native (32% of users)*:
- Expected instant, frictionless mobile experience
- Frustrated by lengthy forms and unclear error messages
- Preferred visual feedback and minimal text instructions
- Likely to abandon after first failure

*The Traditional Planner (41% of users)*:
- Preferred desktop experience with detailed information
- Valued comprehensive forms and clear documentation
- Needed reassurance about security and compliance
- Willing to invest time for thorough completion

*The Assisted User (18% of users)*:
- Required help from customer service or family members
- Needed simplified workflows and clear guidance
- Appreciated human touchpoints during digital processes
- Often managing healthcare for multiple family members

*The Bulk Processor (9% of users)*:
- Business owners or frequent medical expense users
- Needed efficient batch processing capabilities
- Valued advanced features like bulk upload and categorization
- Demanded detailed reporting and audit trails

**Cross-Device Journey Mapping**:
Research revealed that successful task completion often involved multiple devices and sessions:

*[Reference: Section 5 in design mockups - "Cross-Device User Journey" showing the specific journey from doctor visit ‚Üí mobile attempt ‚Üí upload failure ‚Üí desktop retry ‚Üí customer service call, demonstrating why 78% start on mobile but 45% switch to desktop]*

- Initial attempt on mobile (during or immediately after medical appointment)
- Research and preparation phase on desktop (understanding requirements)
- Final submission on preferred device based on complexity
- Status checking across multiple channels (app, email, web)

**Competitive Analysis Insights**:
- HSA Bank offered simpler upload but lacked intelligent categorization
- Fidelity HSA had better error handling but more complex navigation
- Bank of America's solution was faster but provided less transparency about approval process
- None of the competitors effectively handled cross-device continuity

*[Reference: Section 6 in design mockups - "Competitive Feature Analysis" showing detailed comparison matrix with star ratings across key features like Mobile Upload, Smart Categorization, Status Transparency, and Cross-Device Continuity]*

## üí° **Design Strategy and Solution**

### Design Process: From Research to Solution

**Initial Concept Exploration:**

*[Note: The conceptual evolution from complex to simplified approaches is demonstrated in the wireframe progression sections of the mockups]*

**Low-Fidelity Wireframes:**

*Mobile Wireframe Evolution*:
*[Reference: Section 7 in design mockups - "Mobile Wireframe Evolution" showing V1 (complex 8+ fields), V2 (simplified), V3 (smart 3-step flow with progress indicators)]*

*Desktop Wireframe Evolution*:
*[Reference: Section 8 in design mockups - "Desktop Wireframe Evolution" showing progression from traditional multi-column form to integrated drag-and-drop to smart progressive disclosure design]*

### Design Principles

Based on research findings, I established four core principles that would guide all design decisions:

1. **Progressive Confidence**: Build user trust through transparent feedback at each step
   - Show users exactly what's happening and why
   - Provide realistic time estimates for each process stage
   - Celebrate small wins throughout the journey
   - Offer clear recovery paths when things go wrong

2. **Context-Aware Guidance**: Provide help based on receipt type and user experience level
   - Recognize receipt types and adjust form complexity accordingly
   - Offer different levels of assistance based on user history
   - Provide just-in-time help without overwhelming newcomers
   - Enable power users to bypass unnecessary guidance

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure functionality across different technical scenarios
   - Design for varying network speeds and device capabilities
   - Provide fallback options when primary methods fail
   - Maintain core functionality even when advanced features are unavailable
   - Enable offline capabilities for essential tasks

4. **Regulatory Transparency**: Make compliance requirements feel helpful, not bureaucratic
   - Explain why information is needed in plain language
   - Show how compliance protects the user's interests
   - Provide educational content that builds trust
   - Make audit trails visible and understandable to users

### Solution Architecture Philosophy

Rather than creating a single redesigned flow, I developed an adaptive system philosophy that could respond intelligently to different user needs and technical constraints. This approach recognized that the diversity of users, receipt types, and usage contexts required multiple optimized pathways rather than one "perfect" solution.

**Information Architecture Redesign:**

*[Reference: Section 9 in design mockups - "New Information Architecture" showing streamlined navigation with reimbursement prominently featured on main dashboard and single integrated flow replacing separate sections]*

**Adaptive Design Strategy**:
- Multiple interaction paths based on user type and context
- Intelligent routing based on receipt recognition and user history
- Progressive enhancement that leveraged device and network capabilities
- Fallback systems that maintained functionality under any conditions

**High-Fidelity Design System:**

*[Reference: Section 10 in design mockups - "Design System Components" showing UI elements, Optum brand color palette (Primary Orange #FF6900, Text Gray, Success Green, Error Red), typography scale, and interaction patterns for consistent cross-platform experience]*

## üîß **Technical Collaboration and Implementation**

### Working with Engineering Constraints

**File Upload Architecture Challenges**:
The existing system used a monolithic upload approach that attempted to handle file processing, validation, and approval routing in a single API call. This created multiple failure points and poor user feedback.

*Collaborative Solution Design*:
- Worked with backend team to implement chunked upload for large files
- Designed asynchronous processing with transparent user feedback
- Created compression algorithm that maintained receipt readability for OCR
- Built offline capability for capturing receipts without immediate internet connection
- Developed retry logic that was completely transparent to users

**API Design Collaboration**:
Rather than working around existing APIs, I collaborated with the engineering team to redesign endpoints that better supported user experience goals.

*Key Improvements*:
- Defined error response formats that enabled specific, actionable user guidance
- Created status polling system that provided real-time updates without overloading servers
- Designed intelligent caching strategy for reference data (tax rules, provider lists, historical submissions)
- Implemented progressive loading patterns for users with slower connections
- Built redundant data pathways for critical operations

**Performance Optimization Strategy**:
Working within the constraint of legacy backend systems, we focused on perceived performance improvements that didn't require major infrastructure changes.

*Implementation Details*:
- Lazy loading for form sections based on detected receipt type
- Background image optimization pipeline that processed receipts after successful upload
- Database query optimization for faster status lookups and historical data retrieval
- CDN implementation for static educational content and help resources
- Client-side caching for user preferences and frequently accessed data

**Security and Compliance Integration**:

## üß† **Key Learnings and Design Insights**

### Designing for Regulation as a Feature

Initially, I viewed compliance requirements as constraints that hindered user experience. Through this project, I learned to reframe regulatory requirements as trust-building opportunities that could actually enhance user confidence.

**Transformation Example**: 
Instead of hiding the fact that IRS rules required certain documentation types, I made this transparency part of the value proposition: "The IRS requires this receipt format to ensure your reimbursement is tax-compliant and you won't have issues during tax season. We're protecting your financial future."

**Key Insight**: Users preferred understanding complexity over being confused by false simplicity. When users understood why certain steps were necessary, they were more likely to complete them successfully.

**Application**: This learning shaped how I approached all compliance-related design decisions, turning potential friction points into opportunities to build user trust and education.

### Multi-Path Solutions Beat Single "Perfect" Flows

Traditional UX wisdom suggests optimizing for the primary user journey, but this project revealed that serving diverse user needs required fundamentally different approaches rather than variations on a single theme.

**Evidence**: User research revealed four distinct user types with genuinely different success patterns:
- Digital Natives succeeded with streamlined mobile flows
- Traditional Planners preferred comprehensive desktop experiences  
- Assisted Users needed guided workflows with human touchpoints
- Bulk Processors required advanced features and batch capabilities

**Design Response**: Rather than forcing all users through one optimized flow, I created adaptive pathways that recognized user type and context, then routed them to the most appropriate experience.

**Impact**: This approach improved completion rates across all user segments rather than optimizing for one group at the expense of others.

### Technical Constraints Drive Innovation

Working within significant technical limitations‚Äîlegacy systems, API constraints, processing delays‚Äîforced creative solutions that ultimately provided better user experiences than unlimited resources might have enabled.

**Example**: Upload size restrictions led to progressive image compression techniques that actually improved performance for all users, not just those hitting limits.

**Innovation Through Limitation**: 
- Network variability constraints led to offline capability development
- Processing delays drove transparent status communication systems
- Legacy system integration forced modular design approaches that improved maintainability
- Security requirements inspired user-facing privacy controls that increased trust

**Strategic Learning**: Constraints, when properly understood and designed for, often lead to more robust and user-friendly solutions than greenfield development.

### Cross-Device Design Is System Design

User behavior revealed that successful task completion often spanned multiple devices and sessions. This required thinking beyond individual screen design to system-level experience orchestration.

**Behavioral Insight**: 78% of users started tasks on mobile but 45% switched to desktop, indicating that device choice was context-dependent rather than preference-based.

**System Design Response**:
- State synchronization across all platforms
- Context preservation during device switching
- Platform-optimized interactions while maintaining experience continuity
- Progressive disclosure that adapted to screen real estate and interaction capabilities

**Broader Application**: This learning influenced how I approach all enterprise design challenges‚Äîsuccessful experiences require system thinking that goes beyond individual touchpoints.

### Measuring Success in Enterprise Context

Traditional consumer app metrics (DAU, session length, conversion rates) told only part of the story in an enterprise healthcare context. Success required balancing user satisfaction with operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

**Multi-Dimensional Success Framework**:
- User Experience: Completion rates, satisfaction scores, error recovery success
- Business Operations: Support cost reduction, processing efficiency, retention impact
- Technical Performance: System reliability, response times, error rates
- Compliance Adherence: Audit trail completeness, regulatory requirement satisfaction

**Key Learning**: Enterprise design success requires proving value across multiple stakeholder perspectives, not just user satisfaction.

### The Role of Trust in Healthcare Financial Design

Healthcare financial applications operate in a unique trust environment where users are simultaneously managing health data, financial information, and tax implications. Design decisions that might work in other contexts can fail due to trust considerations.

**Trust Design Principles Developed**:
- Transparency over efficiency when handling sensitive information
- Educational content that builds confidence rather than streamlines processes
- Multiple confirmation steps for irreversible actions
- Clear data usage and retention policies integrated into user experience
- Human fallback options for complex or sensitive situations

**Impact**: Trust-focused design decisions sometimes slowed task completion but dramatically improved user confidence and long-term engagement.
