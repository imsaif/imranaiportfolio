  "commonQuestions": {
    "What was the main problem?": "When I joined this project, the HSA reimbursement feature had a devastating 98.9% abandonment rate - only 1 in 90 users could complete their submissions! Users were struggling with scattered forms, generic error messages, and inconsistent experiences across devices.",
    "How did you research this?": "I had to get creative due to healthcare privacy restrictions. I conducted a 7-week research phase, analyzing 6 months of analytics data and over 800 customer service transcripts, plus stakeholder interviews and process mapping sessions with the support team.",
    "What were the key insights?": "My biggest 'aha moment' was discovering this massive mental model mismatch - users thought about expenses by event like 'my dentist visit' while our system organized by tax category like 'preventive care'. I also identified four very distinct user types with completely different needs.",
    "What was your design approach?": "I realized I needed fundamentally different approaches for different user types. I implemented multi-path solutions, reframed compliance requirements as trust-building opportunities, and used constraints to drive innovation. My strategy focused on progressive disclosure for complex workflows.",
    "What technology did you use?": "I chose React Native for cross-platform mobile experience, Node.js for the backend, AWS OCR for automated receipt processing, and PostgreSQL for data storage with comprehensive audit trails. The OCR was key to eliminating manual data entry.",
    "What were the results?": "I'm really proud of what we achieved! Task completion went from 1.1% to 30% - that's a 27x improvement. We cut completion time from 18 to 10 minutes, improved mobile completion from 0.3% to 18%, and reduced support calls by 30%, saving about $800K annually in support costs.",
    "What did you learn?": "This project taught me to treat regulation as a feature rather than constraint, that diverse user needs require fundamentally different approaches, that constraints can drive innovation, and that mobile optimization had disproportionate impact on overall success."
